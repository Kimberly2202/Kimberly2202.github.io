        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently a sophomore at UC RIverside, with a major in Psychology. Strive to work with children and achieve a career in pediatric occupational therapy. FOr this reason I am very passionate about gaining new opportunities and experiences to be able to develop my skills and learn to be a good role model for children. I am very passionate and hard working, especially when it revolves working with children. I am very patient and I strive to be a good leader. I have worked as a camp leader for a summer program at a charter school. I was in charge of 15 to 20 third graders, and through this experience I was able to gain new skills and learn from any mistakes I made. It allowed me to learn that I am good at communicating and resolving conflicts among the childrens and making sure the students are respectful. I am able to make the class fun and interactive so students are able to be excited to learn. I learned that I do have patience and I am able to stay calm in stressful situations. I also learned that it can be difficult to lead a class, students have good and bad days, and it is important to remember that children are learning everyday how to be human beings.<br><br>

        I am currently working as an after school instructor at an elementary school for kindergarteners. In my role as a mentor I have seen the resilience and adaptability of children, and their endless energy and enthusiasm. One of my main responsibilities was leading educational activities that sparked their interest in different subjects. For example, in an interactive activity where they played a gameI introduced hands-on experience on being respectful of one another and still having fun. Watching their faces light up as they were able to complete an activity and have fun was rewarding. Additionally, working with children requires a deep well of patience and understanding. I have learned to navigate their emotional behaviors, recognizing that their behavior is often a reflection of their feelings and experiences. Whether it was calming a child who was overwhelmed by new surroundings or celebrating small victories with those who struggled academically, each moment has taught me empathy and active listening. These skills are crucial for allowing a safe environment. Furthermore, I have been able to work with diverse groups of children, each bringing their own backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives. This has allowed me to broaden my understanding of inclusivity and learning that it is  important to meet each of their needs.  I’ve learned that creating an inclusive environment—where every child feels seen, heard, and respected—fosters greater engagement and promotes social skills. Incorporating activities that celebrate different cultures, such as international days or storytelling sessions, has enriched our learning environment and encouraged open dialogue about diversity.<br><br>

        Reflecting on my experiences, I am constantly reminded of the profound impact that positive role models can have on children. I strive to be that figure, someone who inspires them to dream big. Seeing children grow and evolve over time, whether it’s developing new skills or gaining confidence in themselves, fills me with a deep sense of purpose. Overall, my small but joyous journey working with children has shaped my values, growing my passion for education and mentorship. As I continue to engage with young minds, I am excited about the endless possibilities for growth, learning, and the meaningful connections that lie ahead.
